# Flask Chess ♟️

Originally a local Python project with command-line input and output, this application was transformed into a web-based interactive game using Flask. It modernizes the user experience by providing an intuitive web interface where players can click to move pieces, view possible moves, and track game progress in real time. The project is fully containerized with Docker enabling easy deployment. 

It serves as a demonstration of back-end development, web application design, and Docker-based deployment.
